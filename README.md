ClokLand - A 4-Elements Blockchain
There is a new world to build. It is a Web3 home where the 4-elements of Hip hop and blockchains combine. ClokLand - Where every element has a voice. ClokLand is a metaverse on the ClokChain. ClokLand includes a 4 elements choose-your-own-adventure game,a virtual venue, and stores to buy artist merch.  The DEX is embedded with dAPPs to create custom artists tokens, NFTs, buy/sell/trade, and build liquidity. And ClokLand wouldn't be complete without the DAO to organize. ClokLand  showcases that the best usecase for any blockchain is the development of a web3 community based ecosystem where the 4-elements of Hip hop—Emceein’, DJing, Breaking, and Graffiti—can truly flourish.
